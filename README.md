## Overview

The **Solana Automated Trading Bot** is a Python-based application designed to execute automated trading strategies on the Solana blockchain. Leveraging the powerful **Jupiter SDK**, this bot filters high-potential Solana tokens from Dexscreener, manages trades with predefined milestones and stop-loss parameters, executes trades through the Jupiter API, and implements a Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) strategy for profit-taking.

## Features

- **Token Filtering**: Automatically filters Solana tokens based on liquidity, transaction volume, holder distribution, and historical performance.
- **Trade Management**: Treats each trade as an independent entity with specific investment percentages, milestones, and stop-loss parameters.
- **Jupiter SDK Integration**: Seamlessly executes swaps, manages limit orders, and handles DCA strategies using the Jupiter SDK.
- **Profit-Taking Strategy**: Implements a DCA strategy to sell positions at 30%, 65%, and 100% gains.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Utilizes asynchronous programming for efficient and non-blocking execution.
- **Secure Configuration**: Stores sensitive information securely using environment variables.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the trading bot, ensure you have the following:

1. **Python Environment**: Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system.
2. **Solana Wallet**: A Phantom wallet set up with sufficient SOL for transaction fees.
3. **Jupiter SDK Access**: Obtain API access credentials if required.
4. **Solana RPC Endpoint**: Access to a Solana RPC node (e.g., [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/), [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/)).
5. **Environment Variables**: Securely store your private key and other sensitive information.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/solana-trading-bot.git
    cd solana-trading-bot
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install Required Dependencies**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    **`requirements.txt`**:

    ```plaintext
    jupiter-python-sdk
    solders
    solana
    aiohttp
    base58
    base64
    ```

## Configuration

The bot requires specific environment variables to function securely and effectively. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following configurations:

```dotenv
PRIVATE_KEY=your_base58_encoded_private_key
SOLANA_RPC_ENDPOINT=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
```

**Important**:

- **Never** commit your `.env` file or expose your private key in any public repository.
- Ensure that the private key corresponds to your Phantom wallet and has sufficient SOL for transaction fees.

To load environment variables from the `.env` file, you can use the `python-dotenv` package. Install it and modify your script accordingly:

```bash
pip install python-dotenv
```

Add the following lines at the beginning of your main script:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
```

## Usage

1. **Run the Trading Bot**

    Ensure that your virtual environment is activated and all dependencies are installed.

    ```bash
    python trading_bot.py
    ```

2. **Bot Workflow**

    - **Token Filtering**: The bot fetches the latest Solana token profiles from Dexscreener and filters them based on predefined criteria such as liquidity, transaction count, holder distribution, and historical performance.
    - **Trade Setup**: For each valid token, the bot sets up trades with specified investment percentages (5%, 10%, 15%, 20%) of the total budget.
    - **Trade Execution**: Trades are executed using the Jupiter SDK, handling swaps and limit orders as per the strategy.
    - **Profit-Taking**: Implements a DCA strategy to sell portions of the holdings at 30%, 65%, and 100% gains.
    - **Monitoring**: Continuously monitors active trades for price changes to manage milestones and stop-loss triggers.

3. **Monitoring and Logs**

    The bot prints logs to the console detailing the status of trades, executed transactions, and any errors encountered. For a more robust logging system, consider integrating Python's `logging` module.

## Project Structure

```
solana-trading-bot/
├── trading_bot.py
├── requirements.txt
├── README.md
└── .env
```

- **`trading_bot.py`**: The main script containing the trading logic.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all Python dependencies.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation for the project.
- **`.env`**: Stores environment variables (not committed to version control).

## Security Considerations

- **Private Key Protection**: Your Solana wallet's private key is sensitive. Store it securely using environment variables or secure vault services. **Never** hard-code it into your scripts or expose it publicly.
- **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables to manage configuration settings securely.
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling to manage exceptions gracefully and prevent unexpected behavior.
- **Rate Limiting**: Be mindful of API rate limits to avoid being throttled or banned. Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff if necessary.
- **Testing**: Always test your bot in a sandbox or testnet environment with minimal funds before deploying it with significant investments.
